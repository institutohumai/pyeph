The Pyeph library aims to facilitate Python-based processing of the [Permanent Household Survey (EPH)](https://www.indec.gob.ar/indec/web/Institucional-Indec-BasesDeDatos) periodically published by INDEC. It is designed as a centralized space that consolidates calculations related to these surveys for subsequent use in research, articles, publications, etc.

This library emphasizes methodological transparency through open-source licensing and promotes collaboration among communities of data scientists, social scientists, researchers, developers, journalists, and other curious minds.

It enables downloading `EPH` files as well as other datasets like the basic food `basket` and `adult equivalent` measurements, along with providing quick calculations related to them.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [pip](https://www.pypi.org/)

### Installing PyEPH

- Run in your system terminal:

```bash
$ pip install pyeph
```

## Basic Usage


Below are some examples. For full documentation, see the links at the bottom.



- Data Retrieval

```python
import pyeph

# Obtenci√≥n
eph = pyeph.get(data="eph", year=2021, period=2, base_type='individual') # EPH individual
basket = pyeph.get(data="basket") # Total and food basic baskets
equivalent_adult = pyeph.get(data="equivalent-adult") 

```

- Poverty Calculations


```python
poverty = pyeph.Poverty(eph, basket)
population_poverty = poverty.population(group_by='CH04') # Poverty by gender
labeled_poverty = pyeph.map_labels(population_poverty) # Labeled variables

```

- Labor Market Calculations


```python
labor_market = pyeph.LaborMarket(eph)
unemployment = labor_market.unemployment(group_by="REGION", div_by="PT") # Unemployment by region (vs. total population)
labeled_unemployment = pyeph.map_labels(unemployment) # Labeled variables

```
